## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Compliance Management System

type ComplianceManager struct {
    validator       ComplianceValidator
    monitor         ComplianceMonitor
    reporter        ComplianceReporter
    auditor         ComplianceAuditor
}

// ComplianceCheck represents a compliance check
type ComplianceCheck struct {
    ID              string
    Type            CheckType
    Status          CheckStatus
    Risk            RiskLevel
    Details         map[string]interface{}
    CreatedAt       time.Time
    UpdatedAt       time.Time
}

// ComplianceReport represents a compliance report
type ComplianceReport struct {
    ID              string
    Type            ReportType
    Period          time.Time
    Findings        []Finding
    Status          ReportStatus
    GeneratedAt     time.Time
}

func (cm *ComplianceManager) ProcessCompliance(
    ctx context.Context,
    check *ComplianceCheck,
) (*ComplianceResult, error) {
    // Validate compliance
    // Monitor status
    // Generate reports
    // Audit process
}
```

#### Risk Assessment
```go
// RiskManager handles risk assessment
type RiskManager struct {
    assessor        RiskAssessor
    validator       RiskValidator
    monitor         RiskMonitor
    reporter        RiskReporter
}

// RiskAssessment represents a risk assessment
type RiskAssessment struct {
    ID              string
    Type            AssessmentType
    Score           float64
    Level           RiskLevel
    Factors         []RiskFactor
    CreatedAt       time.Time
}

func (rm *RiskManager) AssessRisk(
    ctx context.Context,
    assessment *RiskAssessment,
) (*AssessmentResult, error) {
    // Assess risk
    // Validate assessment
    // Monitor changes
    // Generate report
}
```

#### Compliance Monitoring
```go
// ComplianceMonitor handles compliance monitoring
type ComplianceMonitor struct {
    metrics         map[string]Metric
    alerts          []Alert
    analyzer        ComplianceAnalyzer
    reporter        MonitorReporter
}

// ComplianceMetric represents a compliance metric
type ComplianceMetric struct {
    ID              string
    Type            MetricType
    Value           float64
    Threshold       float64
    Trend           []float64
    LastUpdated     time.Time
}

func (cm *ComplianceMonitor) MonitorCompliance(
    ctx context.Context,
    check *ComplianceCheck,
) (*MonitoringResult, error) {
    // Collect metrics
    // Analyze patterns
    // Generate alerts
    // Update status
}
```

### 2. Reporting System

#### Report Generation
```go
// ReportGenerator handles compliance reporting
type ReportGenerator struct {
    templates       map[string]ReportTemplate
    dataSources     []DataSource

    Period          time.Time
    Data            map[string]interface{}
    Status          ReportStatus
    GeneratedAt     time.Time
    SubmittedAt     time.Time
}

func (rg *ReportGenerator) GenerateReport(
    ctx context.Context,
    reportType ReportType,
    period time.Time,
) (*Report, error) {
    // Collect report data
    // Apply templates
    // Validate report
    // Generate final report
}
```

### 3. Audit System

#### Audit Logging
```go
// AuditLogger handles compliance auditing
type AuditLogger struct {
    storage         AuditStorage
    formatters      []LogFormatter
    validators      []LogValidator
}

// AuditLog represents a compliance audit log
type AuditLog struct {
    ID              string
    Action          string
    Actor           string
    Target          string
