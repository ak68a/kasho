### Money Movement Flows

#### 1. Transfer Flow
```mermaid

    participant S as Sender
    participant P as Payment System
    participant V as Validator
    participant R as Recipient
    participant N as Network

    S->>P: Initiate Transfer
    P->>V: Validate Request
    V->>P: Confirm Valid
    P->>N: Process Payment
    N->>R: Credit Funds
    R->>S: Confirm Receipt
```

#### 2. Settlement Flow
```mermaid

    participant T as Transaction
    participant P as Processor
    participant B as Bank
    participant S as Settlement
    participant R as Reconciliation

    T->>P: Submit Transaction
    P->>B: Request Settlement
    B->>S: Process Settlement
    S->>R: Reconcile Accounts
    R->>T: Update Status
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Payment Processing System

#### Transfer Processing
```go
// TransferProcessor handles money movement
type TransferProcessor struct {
    validator       TransferValidator
    router          PaymentRouter
    settlement      SettlementManager
    reconciliation  ReconciliationManager
}

// Transfer represents a money movement
type Transfer struct {
    ID              string
    Type            TransferType
    Amount          decimal.Decimal
    Currency        string
    Source          Account
    Destination     Account
    Status          TransferStatus
    CreatedAt       time.Time
    UpdatedAt       time.Time
}

// Settlement represents a payment settlement
type Settlement struct {
    ID              string
    TransferID      string
    Amount          decimal.Decimal
    Currency        string
    Status          SettlementStatus
    Network         PaymentNetwork
    SettledAt       time.Time
}

func (tp *TransferProcessor) ProcessTransfer(
    ctx context.Context,
    transfer *Transfer,
) (*TransferResult, error) {
    // Validate transfer
    // Route payment
    // Process settlement
    // Reconcile accounts
}
```

#### Payment Routing
```go
// PaymentRouter handles payment routing
type PaymentRouter struct {
    networks        map[string]PaymentNetwork
    rules           []RoutingRule
    optimizer       RouteOptimizer
    monitor         RouteMonitor
}

// PaymentRoute represents a payment path
type PaymentRoute struct {
    ID              string
    TransferID      string
    Network         PaymentNetwork
    Cost            decimal.Decimal
    Duration        time.Duration
    Priority        int
    Status          RouteStatus
}

func (pr *PaymentRouter) RoutePayment(
    ctx context.Context,
    transfer *Transfer,
) (*PaymentRoute, error) {
    // Evaluate routes
    // Select optimal path
    // Reserve capacity
    // Execute routing
}
```

### 2. Settlement System

#### Settlement Management
```go
// SettlementManager handles payment settlements
type SettlementManager struct {
    processor       SettlementProcessor
    validator       SettlementValidator
    reconciler      SettlementReconciler
    reporter        SettlementReporter
}

// SettlementBatch represents a settlement batch
type SettlementBatch struct {
    ID              string
    Date            time.Time
    Transactions    []Transfer
    TotalAmount     decimal.Decimal
    Currency        string
    Status          BatchStatus
    ProcessedAt     time.Time
}

func (sm *SettlementManager) ProcessSettlement(
    ctx context.Context,
    batch *SettlementBatch,
) (*SettlementResult, error) {
    // Process batch
    // Validate settlements
    // Reconcile accounts
    // Generate reports
}
```

- Compliance issues
- System issues

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```go
func TestTransferProcessing(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name      string
        transfer  *Transfer
        want      *TransferResult
    }{
        {
            name: "successful internal transfer",
            transfer: &Transfer{
                Type:     TransferTypeInternal,
                Amount:   decimal.NewFromFloat(100.00),
                Currency: "USD",
            },
            want: &TransferResult{
                Status: TransferStatusCompleted,
                Error:  nil,
            },
        },
        // Add more test cases
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test transfer processing
        })
    }
}
```

### Integration Tests
