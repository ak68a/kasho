## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Settlement Processing System

#### Settlement Management
```go
// SettlementManager handles settlement processing
type SettlementManager struct {
    processor       SettlementProcessor
    validator       SettlementValidator
    reconciler      SettlementReconciler
    reporter        SettlementReporter
}

// Settlement represents a settlement process
type Settlement struct {
    ID              string
    Type            SettlementType
    Amount          decimal.Decimal
    Currency        string
    Status          SettlementStatus
    BatchID         string
    CreatedAt       time.Time
    UpdatedAt       time.Time
}

// SettlementBatch represents a batch of settlements
type SettlementBatch struct {
    ID              string
    Type            BatchType
    Settlements     []Settlement
    Status          BatchStatus
    ProcessedAt     time.Time
}

func (sm *SettlementManager) ProcessSettlement(
    ctx context.Context,
    settlement *Settlement,
) (*SettlementResult, error) {
    // Validate settlement
    // Process settlement
    // Handle reconciliation
    // Generate reports
}
```

#### Settlement Processing
```go
// SettlementProcessor handles settlement execution
type SettlementProcessor struct {
    executor        SettlementExecutor
    validator       SettlementValidator
    monitor         SettlementMonitor
    reporter        SettlementReporter
}

// ProcessingResult represents settlement processing result
type ProcessingResult struct {
    SettlementID    string
    Status          ProcessingStatus
    Error           error
    Details         map[string]interface{}
    ProcessedAt     time.Time
}

func (sp *SettlementProcessor) ExecuteSettlement(
    ctx context.Context,
    settlement *Settlement,
) (*ProcessingResult, error) {
    // Execute settlement
    // Validate result
    // Monitor status
    // Generate report
}
```

### 2. Settlement Monitoring System

#### Settlement Monitoring
```go
// SettlementMonitor handles settlement monitoring
type SettlementMonitor struct {
    metrics         map[string]Metric
    alerts          []Alert
    analyzer        SettlementAnalyzer
    reporter        MonitorReporter
}

// SettlementMetric represents a settlement metric
type SettlementMetric struct {
    ID              string
    Type            MetricType
    Value           float64
    Threshold       float64
    Trend           []float64
    LastUpdated     time.Time
}

func (sm *SettlementMonitor) MonitorSettlement(
    ctx context.Context,
    settlement *Settlement,
) (*MonitoringResult, error) {
    // Collect metrics
    // Analyze patterns
    // Generate alerts
    // Update status
}
```

### 3. Settlement Reconciliation System

```go
// ReconciliationManager handles settlement reconciliation
type ReconciliationManager struct {
    processor       ReconciliationProcessor
    validator       ReconciliationValidator
    reporter        ReconciliationReporter
    monitor         ReconciliationMonitor
}

// Reconciliation represents a reconciliation process
type Reconciliation struct {
    ID              string
    Type            ReconciliationType
    Status          ReconciliationStatus
    Results         []ReconciliationResult
    CreatedAt       time.Time
    UpdatedAt       time.Time
}

func (rm *ReconciliationManager) ProcessReconciliation(
    ctx context.Context,
    reconciliation *Reconciliation,
) (*ReconciliationResult, error) {
    // Process reconciliation
    // Validate results
    // Generate reports
    // Monitor status
}
```

### 4. Settlement Dispute System

```go
// DisputeManager handles settlement disputes
type DisputeManager struct {
    processor       DisputeProcessor
    validator       DisputeValidator
    communicator    DisputeCommunicator
    reporter        DisputeReporter
}

// Dispute represents a settlement dispute
type Dispute struct {
    ID              string
    Type            DisputeType
    Status          DisputeStatus
    Resolution      DisputeResolution
    CreatedAt       time.Time
    UpdatedAt       time.Time
}

func (dm *DisputeManager) ProcessDispute(
    ctx context.Context,
    dispute *Dispute,
) (*DisputeResult, error) {
    // Process dispute
    // Validate resolution
    // Handle communication
    // Generate reports
}
```

        name        string
        settlement  *Settlement
        want        *ProcessingResult
    }{
        {
            name: "successful settlement",
            settlement: &Settlement{
                Type:     SettlementTypeDirect,
                Amount:   decimal.NewFromFloat(1000.00),
                Currency: "USD",
            },
            want: &ProcessingResult{
                Status: ProcessingStatusCompleted,
                Error:  nil,
            },
        },
        // Add more test cases
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test settlement processing
        })
    }
}
```
